## Reporting a Vulnerability

To be quite frank, I don't expect any security vulnerabilities from this site. It's just a fun little sandbox site.
However, in the event that you do find one, you may report it to turtle84375{at}programmer{dot}net.

Reported vulnerabilities will be addressed or at the very least aknowledged within 72 hours.

Reports sent to my email that are NOT security vulnerabiltites will be ignored. Please use the Issues tab to report bugs or request features.
